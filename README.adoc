= OrbitDB Playground

This repository contains example projects for experimenting with `libp2p`, `Helia`
and `OrbitDB`. It consists of two sub projects that can be run together using the
provided `docker-compose.yml` file.

== orbitdb-peer

`orbitdb-peer` is a command line peer written in TypeScript. It uses libp2p to
communicate over WebSockets and stores its data in OrbitDB. After building the
project the peer can be started to create or join a database and publish
entries.

[source,bash]
----
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
----

A pre generated `peer-id.json` file is included and will be copied into the
Docker image. The peer listens on port `10335` when run inside Docker.

== orbitdb-webapp

`orbitdb-webapp` is a small web application built with Vite and TypeScript. It
connects to a running peer through libp2p and allows you to view and add
entries in the database from the browser.

[source,bash]
----
npm install
npm run dev        # development mode
npm run build
npm run preview    # serve the built app
----

The Docker container serves the production build using `vite preview` on port
`4173`.

== Usage with Docker Compose

Both projects can be started together using the provided compose file.

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up --build
----

This launches the peer and the web application. The web UI will be available on
`http://localhost:8080` and connects to the peer on port `10335`.
